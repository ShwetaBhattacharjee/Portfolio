            <p>An aim is a goal or objective to achieve in life.
                In order to succeed in life, one must have a goal.
                My aim in life is to be a teacher.
                Teaching is a noble and responsible profession.
                I have come to know that the ever-increasing misery and distress, are due to the ignorance and
                illiteracy of the people of our country. So I have decided to spread education among the masses as much
                as possible within my humble power. As a teacher,
                I shall try my best to impart man-making education.
                Some say that money is the honey of life. But I do not agree with them. Rather, I think that morality is
                the real honey of life. I want to be a lovable and respectable person as a teacher in the future.</p>
